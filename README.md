# Crystal 2
An offline physically-based ray-tracing renderer, based on my old project Crystal Engine. The architecture of this project is largely based on PBRT-v3, but specific implementations are done by myself. The goal of this project is to build a physically-based renderer from scratch, learn and practice various global illumination algorithms, and can even be used as pre-processing tool for real-time rendering.

## How to compile
```
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
```

## Useage
```
$ ./Crystal2 <config file> <scene file>
```
